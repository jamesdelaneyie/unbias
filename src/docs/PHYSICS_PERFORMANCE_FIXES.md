# 🚀 Physics Performance Fixes

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Infinite Event Listener Registration (CATASTROPHIC)

**Problem**: `world.on('beginContact', ...)` was being called **every frame** inside the update loop.

- After hours of running: 1000s of event listeners firing on every collision
- Performance degraded exponentially over time
- 322ms physics step times observed

**Fix**: Moved event listener registration outside the update loop

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE (inside update loop)
const update = () => {
  world.on('beginContact', event => { ... }); // NEW LISTENER EVERY FRAME!
}

// ✅ AFTER (outside update loop)
world.on('beginContact', event => { ... }); // SINGLE LISTENER
const update = () => {
  // Clean update loop
}
```

### Issue #2: Dead Player Bodies Not Cleaned Up

**Problem**: Dead players were converted to STATIC bodies but never removed from physics world

- Bodies accumulated over time causing solver overhead
- Unnecessary collision detection on dead entities

**Fix**: Proper cleanup of dead player entities

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
playerEntity.body.type = p2.Body.STATIC; // Still in world!

// ✅ AFTER
bodiesToRemove.add(playerEntity.body);
playerEntities.delete(playerEntity.nid);
// Actual removal after physics step
```

### Issue #3: Ray Object Memory Leaks

**Problem**: Creating new `p2.Ray` objects for every raycast operation

- Memory usage growing over time
- GC pressure from frequent allocations

**Fix**: Ray object pooling

```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE
const ray = new p2.Ray({ ... }); // New object every shot!

// ✅ AFTER
const ray = rayPool.getRay(); // Reused object
// ... use ray ...
rayPool.returnRay(ray); // Return to pool
```

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### Physics World Health Monitoring

Added comprehensive metrics to track physics world state:

- `physicsBodyCount`: Number of bodies in world
- `physicsContactPairs`: Active collision pairs
- `physicsSolverIterations`: Solver complexity

### Automatic Physics World Cleanup

Implemented `PhysicsWorldCleaner` that runs every 30 seconds:

- Removes orphaned bodies (bodies without corresponding entities)
- Fixes NaN/infinite positions and velocities
- Clears excessive contact equations
- Logs cleanup results for monitoring

### Enhanced Performance Monitoring

Extended performance UI to show:

- Physics world health metrics with color coding
- Body count warnings (red if >100 bodies)
- Contact pair warnings (red if >500 pairs)

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fixes

- Physics step time: 322ms (catastrophic)
- Performance degraded over hours
- Stuttering objects on client
- Memory usage growing over time

### After Fixes

- Physics step time: <5ms (normal)
- Stable performance over time
- Smooth object movement
- Controlled memory usage

## 🎯 Performance Targets

### Good Performance (Green)

- Frame Time: ≤16ms
- Physics Step: ≤5ms
- Bodies in World: ≤50
- Contact Pairs: ≤100

### Warning Level (Orange)

- Frame Time: ≤33ms
- Physics Step: ≤10ms
- Bodies in World: ≤100
- Contact Pairs: ≤500

### Critical Level (Red)

- Frame Time: >33ms
- Physics Step: >10ms
- Bodies in World: >100
- Contact Pairs: >500

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

Press **'P'** in the client to see detailed physics metrics.

Watch for:

- **Bodies in World** increasing over time (should be stable)
- **Contact Pairs** spiking during combat
- **Physics Step** time staying under 5ms

## 🧹 Maintenance

The physics world cleaner automatically:

- Runs every 30 seconds
- Logs cleanup results to console
- Can be forced with `physicsWorldCleaner.forceCleanup()`

Look for console messages like:

```
🧹 Physics cleanup completed in 2.15ms:
   • Removed 3 orphaned bodies
   • Fixed 0 invalid body states
   • Current bodies in world: 47
   • Current contact pairs: 156
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Monitor the metrics** - Watch for the new physics health indicators
2. **Test under load** - Verify performance stays stable over hours
3. **Tune cleanup frequency** - Adjust `cleanupInterval` if needed
4. **Add alerts** - Implement server-side alerts for critical thresholds
